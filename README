Plugin GIMP : Fourier Transform

I.   What it does

 It does a direct and reverse Fourier Transform.
 It allows you to work in the frequency domain.
 For instance, it can be used to remove moiré patterns from
 images scanned from books. (See README.Moire)

II.  Use 

 It adds menu items :
   Filters/Generic/FFT Forward
   Filters/Generic/FFT Inverse

III. Installation

 Github Source Code:
   You will need to run two steps before you can run ./configure

   $ autoreconf -i
   $ automake --foreign -Wall

 Linux:
   Before you can run ./configure, you will need to load the development
   packages for gimp, fftw3 and glib.
    (debian/ubuntu : sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libgimp2.0-dev)

   In Linux, GIMP will only search the shared GIMP/2.0/plug-ins directory,
   Therefore you need to first set --bindir= to the correct location.
   The default location may be /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/ or if you built
   your own copy of GIMP it may be /usr/local/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/ or
   maybe another location which you will need to look around for.
   Assuming the default location is /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/ then do this:

   $ ./configure --bindir=/usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins
   $ make
   $ make strip
   $ su
   # make install
   # exit
   $

 Win32: 
 
   Binaries for win32 are provided (in a separate package), just copy the files
   in the plugins directory of :
   your personal gimp directory (ex: .gimp-2.2\plug-ins), 
   or in the global directory (C:\Program Files\GIMP-2.2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins)
   
   If you don't have fftw3 installed on your system, you must download 
   the provided fftw3.dll, and copy it where you stored the plugin.

   You can compile it with the free environment DevCPP (mingw compiler). 
   You will need several DevPak : fftw3, GTK and gimp-dev (available on 
   devpaks.org). gimp-dev is designed to work with binaries version of 

 Maintainers:
   To create a distributable fourier-{version}.tar.gz file, you
   will need to do these steps:
   First, update the MAJOR.MINOR version in configure.ac, and then:

   $  wget -O config.guess 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD'
   $  wget -O config.sub 'https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD'
   $ autoreconf -i
   $ automake --foreign -Wall
   $ ./configure
   $ make dist
   $ ls -l
   (you should see a tar file named fourier-0.4.3.tar.gz in the directory)
   (copy fourier-0.4.3.tar.gz to your release webpage)

   
History :
 v0.1.1 : First release of this plugin
 v0.1.2 : BugFixes by Mogens Kjaer <mk@crc.dk>, May 5, 2002 
 v0.1.3 : Converted to Gimp 2.0 (dirty conversion)
 v0.2.0 : Many improvements from Mogens Kjaer <mk@crc.dk>, Mar 16, 2005
              * Moved to gimp-2.2
              * Handles RGB and grayscale images
              * Scale factors stored as parasite information
              * Columns are swapped
 v0.3.0 : Great Improvement from Alex Fernández with dynamic boosting :
              * Dynamic boosted normalization : 
                    fft/inverse loss of quality is now un-noticeable 
              * Removed the need of parasite information
 v0.3.1 : Zero initialize padding (patch provided by Rene Rebe)
 v0.3.2 : GPL, Fixed Makefile with pkg-config
 v0.4.0 : Patch by Edgar Bonet :
             * Reordered the data in a more natural way
             * No Fourier coefficient is lost
 v0.4.1 : Select Gray after transform + doc (patch by Martin Ramshaw)
 v0.4.2 : Makefile patch by Bob Barry (gcc argument order)
 v0.4.3 : Makefile patch by bluedxca93 (-lm argument for ubuntu 13.04)
 
Many thanks to Mogens Kjaer, Alex Fernández, Rene Rebe, Edgar Bonet,
Martin Ramshaw, Bob Barry and bluedxca93 for their contributions.
